# {{$frontmatter.title}}

For my thesis, I've analyzed the problem of countywide gas consumption. I had
data from a Croatian county that contained daily and hourly gas consumptions
combined with weather data (temperature) and timestamps of the measurements.
I've taken this data and applied various machine learning algorithms on it,
trying to generate models that can correctly forecast gas consumptions several
days ahead.

This research ended up used in a conference paper which can be read
[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8400195).
